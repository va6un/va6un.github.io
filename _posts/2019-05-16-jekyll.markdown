This blog is created using jekyll and hosted in github. To create static webpages jekyll is a nice option. To use jekyll and generate webpage first we need to install jekyll on our system. The installation is a straight forward one on an ubuntu machine. I am using Ubuntu 18.04 and the installation procedure for all supported OS's can be found [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). For [installing jekyll on an ubuntu machine](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/) run these on terminal

Need these dependencies before jekyll installation

```shell
sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev
```

```shell
sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev
```

Add the environment variables to `~/.bashrc` by executing this

```shell
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GEM_HOME="\$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Install jekyll by `gem install` command

```shell
gem install jekyll bundler
```

To create a boiler plate site

```shell
jekyll new sample-site
```

To create a new site from scratch all we need is a `_config.yml`. So create a file named `_config.yml` and add some these datas, in which site settings are needed for site meta data details and build settings are for as name suggests build!

```yaml
#Site settings
title: <title>
email: <email>
description: <description>
url: <site_url>
author: <author_name>
#Build settings
markdown: kramdown
permalink: /:title
```

The `jekyll serve` command will start the development server and the site can be viewd at `localhost:4000`.
