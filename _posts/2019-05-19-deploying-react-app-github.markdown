React apps can be deployed on to github using fairly straight forward way. The details can be found [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment#github-pages-https-pagesgithubcom) with various other deployment options.

`git` must be installed and we need to have the latest `node` version. Also we need to create a github repository corresponding to the app.
