`Objects` of ABAP workbench `that belong together` are contained in a package.

In the ABAP workbench's command field, type in `SE80`. Select `package` from list and type in the 
package name(starting with `Z`) that we indent to create. Create a request as well.

`$TMP` is the default package which is provided by SAP.
