The best way to start a rect app is by using the `create-react-app` module. The installation steps are from react [documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started). So to install the module

```shell
npm install create-react-app
```

To create an app

```shell
npx create-react-app <app-name>
```

To start the app, from the project folder run the `npm start`, which servers the app in `localhost:3000`

```shell
npm start
```

As a starter the `src/App.js` is the place to start.

```shell
├── node_modules
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── public
├── README.md
└── src
```

I have a github repo [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/va6un/react-boilerplate) which is having some of the boilerplate code which I have compiled to learn React. Also created a `gist` for the components.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/va6un/72721dadc51010f787232ad290c2b56d.js"></script>

Hope this might help. Also point out issues and improvements. Will keep updating.
