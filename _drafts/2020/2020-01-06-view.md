Logical representation of one or more tables.

4 types
> 1. Database view
> 2. Projection view
>> * Projection views are used to suppress or mask certain fields in a table (projection), thus minimizing the number of interfaces. A projection view can draw upon only one table.
> 3. Help view
>> * All the tables used in a help view must be linked with foreign keys.
> 4. Maintenance view
